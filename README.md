This is the Minecraft Modpack repository for the Roopie Server.

To use the pack, install Prism Launcher. Everything is for 1.20.1, so create an instance for that version. If you're worried about Java version, use Java 17. Then all you have to do is install Forge and all the mods.

Easiest way to get the mods is to hit the green "code" button, then download zip. Unzip the file and add all the mods to the Prism instance.

Make sure in your instance, you go into the settings, hit the Java tab, and up the memory allocation. 6912+ works just fine.

When in-game, go in the menu-->settings-->controls-->keybinds and scroll down (near bottom) to Origins. Set the ability keybind (starts on G) to R. While many other things claim they are conflicting, they should be fine.

Some mods are for performance, such as Rubidium and Distant Horizons. If you don't care for those, you can remove them.

Everything should be up to date and functional as of 5/1/2024.
