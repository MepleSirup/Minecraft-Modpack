This is the Minecraft Modpack repository for the Roopie Server.

To use the pack, install Prism Launcher. Everything is for 1.20.1, so create an instance for that version. Then all you have to do is install Forge and all the mods.

Easiest way to get the mods is to hit the green "code" button, then download zip. Unzip the file and add all the mods to the Prism instance.

Everything should be up to date and functional as of 5/1/2024.
